Intro
-----

Bomberman-Maze is a 2-player maze/puzzle style game in the style of bomberman.
Each player controls a bomberman in a maze of coins, blocks, and keys and is trying to use his or her bombs to destroy the blocks and find the door.
Just finding the door is not enough however, as the door is locked and you must find the key among the blocks to unlock the door and escape.
Can you be the one to open the door?? Will you collect the most coins?! Beware, though coins and keys are immune to bombs, your bomberman is not.
